Unreal 0.83 Readme, by hogsy

======================================================

I realised I published this without any instructions,
so, here's how you get this working if you're not
sure.

1. Compile everything using Visual Studio 2019, 
make sure x86 is selected as your target platform!
2. Launch the engine with the startup argument '-EDITOR'
which will tell it to load the UnEditor module, which
is required for generating the Unreal.gfx file
3. ???
4. Profit

I should say, my prime focus was getting this compiled and
I'm not really maintaining this any further. I have
another project for a slightly later version of the
code that I've been maintaining on and off, which
uses SDL2 and has support for OpenGL, but it's not
ready to be published quite yet.
